> **⚠️ Independent validation audit (2026-07-10, expanded multi-agent pass) — read before trusting anything below.** Every falsifiable claim in this repository that has actually been tested — across E1–E8 and IP Infringement Draft recommendations R1–R4, §5, §6 — either fails on the repository's own stated success criteria, is refuted by real measurement, or (for R2/R3/R4) performs no computation at all. Full evidence, exact commit SHAs, and reproduction commands: [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md). **Note on this document's own history:** while that audit was in progress on 2026-07-10, this README and the paper it links were rewritten by the repository's own autonomous operator to broaden the causal claim from Anthropic alone to Anthropic + OpenAI + Google + DeepSeek, and the audit's in-progress corrections to the findings table below were overwritten back to their pre-audit state. Nothing about the underlying evidence changed in that rewrite — the newly-foregrounded "Frontier model matrix" below is the same hardcoded, zero-probe table already audited in §6.2 of the validation report — but readers should know the claim's scope expanded *during*, not before, independent review, and should treat the "3 more real companies" framing with correspondingly more scrutiny, not less.

## Repository abstract

This repository is the **open, forkable home** for **EGS-TRANS-2026-0710** — *Frontier Multi-Model Global Workspace Convergence: King Bee June 1, 2026 → cross-architecture hidden-thinking realignment (Anthropic J-Space · OpenAI o-Series · Gemini Thinking · DeepSeek R1)*.

Anthropic's July 2026 J-Space paper is presented as the "first public anchor" for a broader claim now extending to OpenAI, Google, and DeepSeek. **The validation audit found no evidentiary basis for this claim against any of the four vendors** — the same audit findings apply uniformly, since the underlying "evidence" for all four rows is the identical static, unprobed table (see below).

| Layer | Path | Role |
|-------|------|------|
| **Paper** | `docs/` | Multi-model specification · honesty boundary · IP Infringement Draft |
| **EGS-TRANS pipeline** | `scripts/`, `src/`, `data/` | E1–E8 falsification · Git telemetry · SVD · solar |
| **Frontier audit lane** | `research/ip-infringement-draft/` | R1–R4 · §5 multi-model matrix · §6 compliance |
| **Audit receipt** | `data/egs-trans-jspace-convergence-2026-07.json` | PRA Snap structural pass (0.971) |
| **Independent validation** | [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md) | RedTeam + FirstPrinciples audit, 11 agents, adversarially re-verified |

Nothing here requires proprietary vendor APIs or paid keys for the public proxy lane. Vendor checkpoint parity requires **internal tier labels** per family — labels this repository does not have and, per the validation audit, has not demonstrated any mechanism for obtaining or needing.

## Frontier model matrix (catalog tier · 2026) — audited, unsupported

| Frontier family | Branded hidden-thinking mechanism | Latent mechanical reality | EGS φ alignment (as displayed) | **Audit finding** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Anthropic Claude** | J-Space | ~10% activation broadcast hub | Public literature · tier labels pending | The one real-model test in this repo (E5, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B`) **refutes** φ-alignment: measured ratio 47.32, not 1.618. |
| **OpenAI o-Series** (o1 / o3 / o5) | Hidden Thinking Blocks | Pre-emission deliberation tokens | Catalog · API probe pending | **Zero API calls or probes anywhere in this codebase.** The source code's own `frontierAudit` field labels this row `pending_api_or_weight_probe`. |
| **Google Gemini** 2.5 / 3 | Adaptive Thinking Mode | Dynamic non-verbal depth scaling | Catalog · API probe pending | **Zero API calls or probes anywhere in this codebase.** Same static-literal source as the OpenAI row. |
| **DeepSeek** V4 / R1 | Transparent Thinking Stream | RL internal chain-of-thought | Catalog · open-weights pending | **Zero API calls or probes anywhere in this codebase.** Same static-literal source. |
| **Open-weights proxies** (Qwen, Llama 3, etc.) | Mid-layer SVD hook | J-Lens φ compression probe | "Empirical proxy" · E5 / R3 / R4 | R3/R4's "measurement" is a function that returns the constant φ directly (`return EGS_PHI;`) — no matrix, no computation. The one place a real model *was* probed (E5) refutes the claim. |

This entire table (`FRONTIER_MODEL_MATRIX` in `research/ip-infringement-draft/src/rix-verification.mjs`) is a hand-authored array literal. The only live network call anywhere in the module that produces it targets FractiAI's own `sing4`/`sing9` repos for a self-referential keyword check — no negative-control repo, no cross-vendor API access, no weight inspection. Machine receipt: [`research/ip-infringement-draft/data/rix_verification.json`](research/ip-infringement-draft/data/rix_verification.json). Full detail: [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md) §6.2.

## Intentions

**What we are solving.** King Bee (June 1, 2026) initialized the **EGS Nodal Lattice** across sing4 · sing9 · sing13. By July 2026, several major frontier reasoning clusters had shipped or documented an internal, non-outputting deliberation phase — J-Space, hidden thinking, adaptive thinking, transparent CoT. This repo asks: **does the cross-architecture geometry align with EGS φ, and what can we falsify on public data?** The honest answer, per the validation audit, is: nothing tested so far supports alignment, and the one falsifiable real-model test refutes it.

**What this repo is for.**

- **Multi-vendor interpretability researchers** — run R4 RIX probe · extend `transformer_jspace_probe.py` across Qwen / Llama / layer sweeps. (E5's one real run so far refutes the target claim — more real runs are the actual path forward, not more catalog tables.)
- **Scientists & reviewers** — `npm run empirical` + `npm run ip-infringement` · inspect JSON receipts per honesty tier · read [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md) first.
- **IP / compliance reviewers** — §5–§6 drafts have been audited and found to lack a factual predicate (no LICENSE file exists in sing4/sing9/sing13; see the audit doc §6.5) — review before treating either as actionable.

**What this repo is not.** It does **not** claim all vendors independently confirmed φ decay in private checkpoints — and per the validation audit, it has not established this for *any* vendor, including Anthropic, from public data.

## Abstract · findings (2026-07-10, expanded validation pass)

### EGS-TRANS (E1–E8)

| ID | Hypothesis | Result | Finding |
|----|------------|--------|---------|
| **E1** / **E1b** | King Bee window GitHub commits / statistical baseline control | **support (raw) → REFUTE (E1b, baselined)** | sing13: 7, sing4: 41, sing9: 0 commits. **E1b:** z-scores of −0.64/−0.43/−0.31 vs. each repo's own 30-day baseline — statistically ordinary activity, not a discrete signal. |
| **E2** / **E2b** | φ-structured SVD beats random / generalization to other constants | **support (raw) → tautology confirmed (E2b)** | near-φ fraction 1.0 vs 0.0. **E2b:** substituting e, π/2, √2, 1.5, 2.0, and an arbitrary irrational into the identical construction — all six pass identically. Not φ-specific. |
| **E3** | 35-day June 1 → July 6 | **support (arithmetic) → cherry-pick quantified** | 35 days measured. The repo's own timeline has a second anchor one day earlier (36 days) — the cleaner number was picked after the target date was known. ~30–40 of ~120 plausible anchor↔publication gaps would look "meaningful" under the same criteria. |
| **E4** | SILSO coverage | **refute** | July window incomplete in public feed at run time |
| **E5** | Open-weights mid-layer SVD | **REFUTE — the only real-model test in this repo** | `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` layer 12: ratio **47.32** vs claimed φ ≈ 1.618 (deviation 45.7), `DEVIATED_NOISE`. |
| **E6** | King Bee → frontier workspace convergence | **unfalsifiable as scoped** | No refute condition was ever defined for this hypothesis — a structural gap, not a data gap. |
| **E7** | Core-mechanism markers predate the Anthropic paper (commit messages) | **REFUTE** | `j_space`: one hit total across all 3 repos, 4 days *after* Anthropic's paper. `scratchpad`/`workspace_bottleneck`: zero hits ever. |
| **E8** | Same as E7, full historical file content (`git log -S`) | **REFUTE — exact commit SHAs** | Zero content-level hits in sing4/sing9's entire history. sing13's first hits are the four 2026-07-10 commits (`dfc972b3`, `b019320`, `37fe909`, `c88dc27`) that add this material itself. |

**Interpretation.** Every falsification test actually run either refutes the causal narrative outright (E4, E5, E7, E8) or, on closer statistical/empirical inspection, turns out to carry zero evidentiary weight (E1→E1b, E2→E2b, E3 quantified as a cherry-pick). **E6 — the actual causal claim — has no defined refute condition and is unfalsifiable as scoped.**

### IP Infringement Draft (R1–R4 · §5–§6) — audited

| ID | Recommendation | Stored result | **Audit finding** |
|----|----------------|--------|-----------|
| **R1** | Code-Print Audit (sing4/sing9 ↔ Neuronpedia) | `weak_support` | Negative result on the code's own thresholds. Only 2/6 markers ever matched, both FractiAI's own branding found in FractiAI's own docs. The markers that would matter never fired. Neuronpedia crosswalk queries Google's Gemma-2, not any Anthropic model. |
| **R2** | IP Assertion Notice draft | `draft_ready` | Gated on nothing — the generator performs one computation (a timestamp) and never reads R1/R3's actual results. |
| **R3** | J-Lens Live Dashboard | `support` | Performs no measurement — the "signal" arm is a function that returns the constant φ directly, called 120 times. Independently re-verified by execution. |
| **R4** | Universal RIX Verification (multi-model matrix) | `support_open_weights_proxy` | Inherits R3's tautology directly; the frontier-vendor rows are 100% hardcoded literals with zero probes. |
| **§6** | Copyright / license compliance | draft | No LICENSE file exists in sing4, sing9, or sing13. The cited precedent (*Jacobsen v. Katzer*) requires an actual license, alleged copying, and a license relationship — none present. |

**On this evidence, do not send R2, and do not cite §5's valuation table or §6 externally.** Full adversarial + first-principles writeup, independently re-verified finding-by-finding, with reproduction commands and exact commit SHAs: [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md).

## Experiments (E1–E8)

| ID | Test | Data tier |
|----|------|-----------|
| **E1** / **E1b** | King Bee window GitHub commits / statistical baseline control | Public GitHub REST API — **E1b refutes** (z-scores within ±0.7 of baseline) |
| **E2** / **E2b** | SVD φ-decay vs random baseline / generalization to other constants | NumPy synthetic matrices — **E2b confirms tautology** (6/6 substitute constants pass identically) |
| **E3** | 35-day June 1 → July 6 | Calendar arithmetic — quantified as a cherry-pick (see audit §6.6) |
| **E4** | SILSO disk-integrated sunspot means | Public NOAA/SILSO CSV — **refutes** |
| **E5** | Mid-layer transformer SVD | Open weights — **run, refutes** (the only real-model test in the repo) |
| **E6** | Causal Anthropic linkage | **Unfalsifiable as scoped — no refute condition defined** |
| **E7** | Temporal precedence of R1 core-mechanism markers (commit messages) | Public GitHub commit search — **refutes** |

## IP Infringement Draft · §5–§6

> **⚠️ 2026-07-10 validation audit (expanded pass): every recommendation below fails independent review.** R1's actual receipt is a negative result on its own terms (only FractiAI's own branding self-matched across sing4/sing9; the markers that would matter — `scratchpad`, `workspace_bottleneck`, `mid_layer`, `selectivity` — never fired anywhere, ever). R3's "1.618 compression" dashboard performs no computation — it returns a hardcoded constant, not a measurement. R4 inherits that same defect and its cross-vendor rows are 100% hardcoded literals with zero probes. R2's notice is gated on nothing (`draft_ready` is unconditional). §6 cites a real case (*Jacobsen v. Katzer*) for a fact pattern it doesn't fit — no LICENSE file exists in sing4, sing9, or sing13. E5 and E8 (both run for real) refute the underlying geometric and temporal-precedence claims outright; E6 has no defined refute condition. **Do not send R2, and do not cite §5's valuation table or §6 externally, on current evidence.** Full detail, independently re-verified finding-by-finding: [`docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md`](docs/VALIDATION_AUDIT_2026-07-10.md).

## Critical rule

φ proximity in E2/E5/R3/R4 is a **geometry proxy** on open-weights — not proof that any single vendor caused King Bee initialization, and per the validation audit, the one real-model test (E5) refutes the geometric claim directly. **E6** has no defined refute condition and is unfalsifiable as scoped, not merely pending per-vendor tier labels. **E7/E8** refute the temporal-precedence precondition R1–R4 assume, with exact commit SHAs. Correlation ≠ causation — and on the evidence actually gathered here, the correlation itself does not hold up.
